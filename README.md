# eigface_prototype
Face image decomposition and reconstruction using PCA.

PCA is a technique of finding a new axis that preserves the variance of existing data as much as possible and projecting data on that axis.

First, I wrote a code for eigenface that uses the faces of people who are widely used,
and then I collected and tested the images myself to see if it would produce effective results
even if I applied the same code to the faces of dogs.
Using 40 dog face images, the results were quite effective.
